# Interactive-DSA-Operations

ðŸŽ¯ A console-based mini Java project to practice core **Data Structures** in an interactive way.

This project is being built step-by-step to simulate DSA operations in Java for learning and hands-on logic building(For now i am Working Trees and Completed LL,Stacks,Queues).
