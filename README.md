# Interactive-DSA-Operations

ðŸŽ¯ A console-based mini Java project to practice core **Data Structures** in an interactive way.

This project is being built step-by-step to simulate DSA operations in Java for learning and hands-on logic building(For now i am Working Trees and Completed LL,Stacks,Queues).

## Current Features

## Linked List

### 1. Insertion Operations
- Insert at Beginning
- Insert at End
- Insert at the Postion K

### 2. Deletion Operations
- Delete the First Node
- Delete the Last Node(Element)
- Delete the Node(Element) at Kth Position From the Begininng
- Delete the Node(Element) with the Value K From the Begininng

### 3. Freindly Operations
- Search for a Value in the List
- Max and Min Values in the List
- Sum of All the Elements in the List
- Update Node Value at Nth Position
- Shuffle the List
- Move to Next/Previous Node

### 4. Positional Operations
- Delete Middle Node in the List
- Get the Nth Element in the List
- All the Positions where an Element is Present in the List

### 5. Advanced Operations
- Reverse the List
- Sort the List
- Rotations
- Split the List At a Value
### 6. Animated Traversals
- Forward Animated Traversal(Coming Soon)
- Backward Animated Traversal(Coming Soon)
